defmodule MeshxMobileApp.BLE.AttemptOutcome do
  @moduledoc """
  Immutable outcome record for one `MeshxMobileApp.BLE.AttemptLedger.Attempt`.

  Produced by dispatch modules (`MeshxMobileApp.BLE.Dispatcher.DryRun`,
  `MeshxMobileApp.BLE.Transport.Simulated`, and future real-transport
  adapters). Carries enough provenance — `attempt_id`, `message_id`,
  `target_peer_id`, `target_device_ids` — that a consumer can correlate
  outcomes back to the planning trail without inspecting any other
  state.

  ## Closed `kind` taxonomy

    * `:planned` — fresh attempt that hasn't reached a dispatcher yet.
      Equivalent to `Attempt.status` of the same name; included here so
      consumers can hold a uniform list of outcomes for an envelope.
    * `:would_dispatch` — dry-run only; the dispatcher accepted the
      attempt and would have sent it.
    * `:delivered_simulated` — simulated transport reported success.
    * `:failed_simulated` — simulated transport reported failure (the
      `reason` field carries detail).
    * `:dispatched` — **real** transport accepted the attempt. The local
      BLE stack acknowledged the send; that's all we claim. Peer
      reception is not implied — there's no return-path yet.
    * `:failed` — **real** transport rejected the attempt. Distinct
      from `:failed_simulated` so consumers can tell the difference
      between "the fake said no" and "the radio said no".
    * `:skipped` — dispatcher policy chose not to attempt (e.g., a
      caller-supplied skip predicate).
    * `:invalid_attempt` — the attempt itself failed dispatcher-side
      validation (missing fields, malformed identifiers, etc.).

  ## `adapter` taxonomy

  Closed atom set so consumers can route on it:

    * `:dry_run` — produced by `Dispatcher.DryRun`.
    * `:simulated` — produced by `Transport.Simulated`.
    * Future: `:ble_android`, `:ble_ios`, …
